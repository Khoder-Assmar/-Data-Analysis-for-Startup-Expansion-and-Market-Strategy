## Introduction

Startups often face crucial decisions regarding where to expand and how to optimize their marketing spend. This project aims to analyze the key factors affecting store performance, providing insights that guide store expansion decisions and help optimize marketing efficiency.

## Data Collection

The dataset includes:

-City and state of stores
-Marketing spend
-Revenue
-Store ID
-Expansion status (New or Old)
The data was sourced from an Excel file and processed for further analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Key steps in data preprocessing include:

-Inspecting the data for missing or duplicated values
-Exploring categorical variables ('City', 'State', 'Sales Region')
-Calculating summary statistics for numerical variables ('Revenue', 'Marketing Spend')
-Grouping the data by expansion status to evaluate performance across cities and states

## Data Analysis
The analysis included:

-Grouping data by 'New Expansion' and 'Old Expansion' to evaluate store performance
-Identifying the top 10 stores based on revenue across different cities and states
-Calculating total revenue for each state for a broader performance overview

## Profitability Metrics
-A new column for Return on Marketing Spend (ROMS) was added to measure the effectiveness of marketing investments. This metric helps determine how much profit is generated for every dollar spent on marketing.

## Power BI Report
-The processed dataset was exported to CSV and used in Power BI to create a visually intuitive report. This report simplifies the analysis and provides a clear view of store performance, expansion opportunities, and marketing efficiency.

## Conclusion
-This project offers insights into store expansion opportunities and marketing optimization. The analysis provides valuable data to guide decision-making on which stores to expand or invest in further.
