Overview: This project involves analyzing a dataset related to startup expansion, marketing spend, and revenue using Python and Power BI for deeper insights and visualization. Key steps include:

Data Import & Inspection:
Loaded and reviewed an Excel dataset, ensuring no missing or duplicated values.

Data Preprocessing:
Explored categorical and numerical columns. For categorical data (e.g., 'City', 'State'), I counted unique values and occurrences. For numerical data (e.g., 'Revenue', 'Marketing Spend'), I calculated key statistics (mean, min, max).

Key Analysis:

Grouped data by 'New Expansion' to analyze revenue by cities and states.
Evaluated the top 10 stores based on revenue in both 'New' and 'Old' expansions.
Calculated the total revenue for each state rather than just the maximum for a more comprehensive understanding of performance.
Profitability Metrics:
Added a new column for 'Return on Marketing Spend (ROMS)' to measure the profitability of marketing investments. A higher ROMS indicates higher returns from marketing expenses.

File Export & Power BI:
The processed data was saved as a CSV file, which will be used in Power BI to create a report that simplifies and visualizes the findings.

This analysis provides insights into the startup's expansion opportunities and marketing efficiency, aiding decision-making for future growth
